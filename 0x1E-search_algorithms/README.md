search_algos.h (should be included)

This projects contains Search algorithms
Basically, search algrorithms are divided into 3

1. Linear search
2. Binary Search
3. Hashing

#### Task 0: Linear search
A function tha searches for a value in an array of integers using the linear search algorithm

`prototype: int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value)`

Return value is the first index where the value is found.
otherwise -1;

#### Task 1: Binary search
a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

`Prototype: int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value)`
Return value is the first index where the value is found.
otherwise -1;

A utility `print_array` function was also implemented, beloow is its prototype

`Prototype: void print_array(int *arr, int a, int z);`
